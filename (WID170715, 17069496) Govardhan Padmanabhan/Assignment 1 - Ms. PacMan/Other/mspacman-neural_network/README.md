# Mrs.-Pacman-Genetic-Neural-Networks
Added the files

A Neural Network that plays a Mrs. PacMan clone and learns with a Genetic Algoritm
Uses the pacman clone from https://github.com/kefik/MsPacMan-vs-Ghosts-AI

All of the files except the PacManSimulator.java go in "MsPacMan-vs-Ghosts-AI-master\PacMan-vs-Ghosts-Agents\src\game\controllers\pacman\examples"

PacManSimluator.java should replace the same file in "MsPacMan-vs-Ghosts-AI-master\PacMan-vs-Ghosts\src\game"

Run the GenAlg.java class to run it. I would not recomend over 500 nets, and would strongly advise not going over 1000.
